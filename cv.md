## About Me
**Hi!**
My name is Alexandr. I was born in Belarus where I started to make myself a career. Some time later moved to Russia.  Nowadays I work for the international nicotine company British American Tobacco Russia. While working I proved to be one of the 8 best workers (out of 100 workers on the similar vacation in Moscow.

Interesting projects, possibility of personal and careers development , the team itself - that’s what keeps me motivated. I really like to optimize everything; to find out the mistakes, analyze numbers and provide solutions. 

Development areas: fear of flights, English level.

I’m moderately hard-working ( prefer work and life balance theory )  at present I devote much time to my family and self-development. Love traveling with family and friends to Europe.
